                    “thank you for the wonderful classes and your support through pregnancy. It was fantastic to
                    have
                    time to focus on myself and the baby and the classes were really helpful… it was such a
                    different
                    experience to having my first, so calm but incredibly precious. I felt awake and able to bond
                    and
                    have wonderful skin-to-skin straight after he was born. He latched on and is doing really well
