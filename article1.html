                    <p>I am not currently teaching weekly Mum's and babies yoga classes as I am concentrating on the
                        midwifery degree.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Classes</h4>

                    <p>These sessions are for Mum's with babies from birth to crawling age. Relax and enjoy the friendly
                        and welcoming atmosphere which respects the need for babies to feed, cry, sleep, giggle, play,
                        be soothed and join in as they please.

                    </p>

                    <p>Each session will be spontaneous depending on the needs of the group in the moment, but will
                        focus on yoga for mum (post-natal recovery), and yoga together. Expect lots of fun, songs and
                        giggles as you learn yoga postures and movements to support you post-natally. You will also have
                        the opportunity to relax with your baby and learn calming yet focussed yoga concentration
                        practices.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why is yoga good for postnatal women?</h4>

                    <p>Yoga can aid the healing process after birthing your baby. Gentle yoga movements, breathing
                        practices and proper relaxation are especially nurturing during the first 8 weeks after having a
                        baby. Then, working towards restoring vitality as we explore the immense emotional journey which
                        comes with motherhood.

                    </p>

                    <p>You will learn how to stabilise your body after pregnancy (especially the pelvic and lower back
                        area), and how to pay special attention to your posture while feeding and carrying your baby.

                    </p>

                    <p>Yoga can help cultivate an acceptance of the challenges and joys of being a parent, and let
                        yourself truly relax in the presence of your child. Yoga can also stabilise your energy levels
                        at such a demanding time and give you the confidence to trust your intuitive wisdom</p>

                    <h4>Yoga with your baby.</h4>

                    <p>"The experience of movement combined with touch is possibly the richest stimulation we can offer
                        babies from birth."
                        Francoise Barbira Freedman, Birthlight Trust.

                    </p>

                    <p>The benefits of including your baby in your yoga practice come from the quality of attention and
                        communicative interaction between the two of you. There is a tremendous closeness and trust
                        established between parent and child during yoga practice, and the ability to just be with each
                        other while you enjoy mutual unconditional love. Mum's often report babies being calmer, more
                        content and easier to settle to sleep after yoga.</p>

                <p>From a foundation of intellectual study, martial arts and aerobic fitness training, I encountered
                    yoga
                    in my early twenties when pregnant with my first child; I found yoga to be an effective and gentle
                    way
                    to maintain a healthy environment for my unborn baby and myself. I soon discovered that yoga is much
                    greater than a 'keep fit' method. Continuing with over a decade of practice and study, I am
                    deepening
                    the understanding that yoga practice is a way of getting to know body, mind and the energy (prana)
                    which
                    is interwoven through the very fabric of existence. Yoga supports me in acknowledging strengths and
                    weaknesses, to maintain balance in my life, to observe how I can help myself through the challenges
                    met
                    in everyday situations, yoga percolates through all my relationships and encounters. Yoga
                    beautifully
                    and gracefully reveals the spirit which connects all. I have been lucky to meet and study with some
                    wonderfully inspiring teachers and I honour them and their teachers, for enabling the vibrant
                    current of
                    yoga to keep flowing.</p>
                <h4>Qualifications and Training</h4>
                <p>Completing a combined honours degree in Human Biology and Applied Psychology in 1995 sustained my
                    desire
                    to understand the science of body and mind and how they might interact to influence our state of
                    health.
                    During these formal studies I suspected that the western scientific viewpoint might be missing
                    something, it was not a holistic view of reality and I continued to investigate esoteric subjects
                    alongside conventional teachings. While at University, I took courses in Buddhist meditation,
                    Gnostic
                    psychology amongst others, my university final dissertations concerned complementary therapy. After
                    graduation my interest in holistic approaches to health and self understanding grew. The discovery
                    and
                    immediate trust of yoga in 1999 was intuitive and definite, and I have no doubt that this path is
                    worth
                    a lifetime of exploration.
                </p>
                <p>I completed the 3-year British Wheel of Yoga (BWY) Teaching Diploma in June 2008. The BWY are
                    recognised
                    by the Central Council for Physical Recreation (CCPR) and Sport England as the national Governing
                    Body
                    for Yoga in the UK and provide the hightest level of qualification for yoga teachers (NVQ Level 4) .
                    I
                    consider the BWY to offer the most comprehensive yoga teacher training courses available, and I was
                    blessed to be able to train with Derek Thorne. I am committed to my continuous professional
                    development
                    regulated by the BWY and my teaching benefits from the wide range of high quality training
                    opportuinites
                    provided by the BWY as well as trainings from outside of the BWY.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additional training in pregnancy and postnatal yoga was directed by Uma Dinsmore-Tuli (Sitaram
                    Partnership). This training is equivalent to the BWY Post-Diploma Module for yoga in pregnancy, and
                    I
                    have attended update training days with BWY pregnancy and postnatal module tutor Wendy Teasdill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uma Dinsmore-Tuli's teaching is a dominant influence in my approach to hatha yoga. I attend her Womb
                    Yoga classes in Bristol and eagerly await publication of her new book Yoni Shakti Tantra.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Derek Thorne guided my initial teacher training and as my personal teacher he continues to guide me
                    through the profound teachings of jnana yoga. As a member of the YogaLiving Community Ashram, my
                    personal yoga practice is supported by association with regular satsang and active participation in
                    the
                    vibrant creative energy of YogaLiving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been teaching yoga classes in my community since 2006 and love every minute of it! You are
                    welcome to join me and discover yoga for your Self.
