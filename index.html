            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>Carley is a mother, student midwife (NHS), yoga teacher, antenatal teacher and is committed to
                    sharing her passion for the life enhancing experiences of pregnancy, childbirth and parenting. For
                    over 20 years she has been studying health and well being, sparked by her fascination of human
                    potential and evolution in action.</p>

                <p>

                    Her current training as an NHS midwife has prompted her to offer antenatal classes for couples which
                    respond to the needs of individual women and their birth/parenting partners. Carley has been praised
                    by her mentors for her professionalism, excellent communication skills and 'with women'
                    understanding of midwifery. </p>

                <p>
                    With sensitive and nurturing classes, Carley has supported hundreds of women to enjoy healthy
                    pregnancies and positive birth experiences. Carley is currently offering weekly pregnancy yoga
                    classes for women and monthly antenatal classes for couples.

                    ”I spent most of early labour using lots of breathing and leaning over the birthing ball once the
                    pressure was too much to sit down. Once I was in established I took some gas and air but focused
                    mainly on the breathing and I think I did quite well &#9786 We are so happy we were able to birth
                    him at home in such a wonderful environment, currently he is a very peaceful little boy and I
                    believe his entry to this world has helped that.”
